<h2>Me!!</h2>

	I am Lynara Richards and I am currently a Media Studies Major at Hunter College. I am new to media studies however my interest are in editing and photography. These are both new ideas that I want to put my time into to become skills. I want to use both photography and editing to show my outlook on the world and to put other people's ideas to fruition.

For my practice I'm starting to get more into editing. I've done some editing in pevious media classes but I want to take that skill and use it in my free time. I want to venture into photography because I feel like photography and edititng go hand in hand. I want to be able to use what I will be earning in this class to tie all these things together.</section>

			<h2>My Journey</h2>
			<p>My creative journey is allowing me to explore new avenues of photography, editing, and painting. Although my artistic path is just beginning, I am curious to look at the world through these different ways. My recent experiences with painting has always been a comfort and the creative thing I think to do first. Going into photography and editing is my next idea. In my work, I am excited to capture moments that show the authenticity of life but can also be symbolisim for what life could be. My goal is to create visual stories that invite viewers to pause, reflect, and connect with the world in new ways. As I venture into photography and editing I hope to develope my skills to create mediums that relate to people or atleast leave a new unique understanding with them. I hope to be able to share my work and to develop my skills to give my ideas a platform to show themselves.
