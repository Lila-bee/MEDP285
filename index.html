	<h3> Artist Statement</h3>

<p>My creative journey is allowing me to explore new avenues of photography, editing, and painting. Although my artistic path is just beginning, I am curious to look at the world through these different ways. 

My recent experiences with painting has always been a comfort and the creative thing I think to do first. Going into photography and editing is my next idea. In my work, I am excited to capture moments that show the authenticity of life but can also be symbolisim for what life could be. 

My goal is to create visual stories that invite viewers to pause, reflect, and connect with the world in new ways. As I venture into photography and editing I hope to develope my skills to create mediums that relate to people or atleast leave a new unique understanding with them. I hope to be able to share my work and to develop my skills to give my ideas a platform to show themselves.
