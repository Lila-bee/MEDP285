			<h1>The History</h1>
			<p>Medium Spring Green is shown as the hexadecimal code #00FA9A. It consists of 0% red, 98% green, 60% blue. More than just a hexadecimal, Medium Spring Green symbolizes renewal, growth and harmony. There is a relation to fresh greenery, spring season and the energy of new beginnings. Thereâ€™s no specific historical significance  but it is widely used in art to evoke a sense of freshness. It was adapted into many art styles in the 1980s, specifically in the fashion and interior design fields. </p>
